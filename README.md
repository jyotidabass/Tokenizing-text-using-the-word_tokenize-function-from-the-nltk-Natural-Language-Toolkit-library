# Tokenizing-text-using-the-word_tokenize-function-from-the-nltk-Natural-Language-Toolkit-library

Explanation:

TheÂ !pip install nltk command installs the nltk library in Google Colab.

The following lines (nltk.download(...)) download the required NLTK resources, including the punkt tokenizer, a part-of-speech tagger, a named entity chunker, and a list of English words.

The word_tokenize function from the nltk.tokenize module is used to tokenize the input text into a list of words.

The print statement displays the tokenized words.

This simple code demonstrates how to tokenize text into words using the word_tokenize function from the nltk library in Python. Note that NLTK provides various other tokenizers for different purposes, such as sentence tokenization, punctuation tokenization, and more.
